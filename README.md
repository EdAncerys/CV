## Edvinas Ancerys

Highly qualified, tenacious, and well-accomplished professional armed with broad-based background and skills in the areas of retail management in early 2020 I took up the well-known [**Makers Academy**][2] web development course, where I learned the fundamentals of software development by working on different, challenging projects in teams.

I have become hugely passionate about writing code that is clean, tested and reusable. Grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

Experience in: Ruby, Rails, React, Node.js, Javascript, JQuery, PostgreSQL, Jasmine, RSpec, Capybara, Bootstrap, Git, Heroku.

Methodologies: TDD, Agile development, XP values, team projects, code reviews, pair programming.

I am currently looking to take on a career in the tech scene, where I can further expand my knowledge in full-stack development and design.
