## Edvinas Ancerys

After working in hospitality for ten years and living and working abroad in various countries, I wanted a new challenge, and as a creative individual who loves to create, develop and build from ground up, becoming a developer really appealed to me. I love working on projects and in the teams. Seeing them come to life and team grow and succeed is an inspirational moment.

I am currently looking to take on a career in the tech scene of London, where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack development and design.
